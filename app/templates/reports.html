        <p class="poststitle">A report of suggested improvements for the video labelling tool.</p>
        <p>Rayson Yeo, Josiah Rachmat</p>
        <br><br>
        <div class="report">
          <p class="segmenthead">
  Improvements to the Video Labelling Tool:
          </p>
          <p>
  Firstly, the tool does not correctly identify people; it is not 100% reliable in identifying people and in instances mistakes non humans as humans.
  The tool also cannot label people consistently, and switches labels between people consistently if there are more than 1.
          </p>
          <p>
  For example, the 'Person 1' label for a person will continuously swap with a ‘Person 2’ label if there are two people in the video.
          </p>
          <p>
  Secondly, the Fullscreen and Sound function were useless, and labelling was impossible with fullscreen on and there was no sound at all in the videos.
          </p>
          <p>
  Thirdly, the ‘Running’ Label was mostly useless. In all of the 998 videos, there were no instances of anyone running and while it could happen, it is not very likely. Could be replaced by a more likely action.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <p class="segmenthead">
  Lack of user convenience (can be ignored):
          </p>
          <p>
  One needs to scroll up and down continuously to label actions, and the video occupies the entire screen, so the to see the labelling tool, one has to scroll down, being unable to see the video then. Troublesome and time consuming to continue scrolling up and down. Labelling section could be placed to the side of the video for quick easy access.
          </p>
          <p>
  There is also a lack of a ‘Speed Up/Slow down’ function, thus the user has to manually skip parts of the video to quicken the process of labelling. Including such a function could be beneficial and speed up the process.
          </p>
          <p>
  User is also unable to pause or skip parts of the video without using the mouse, as there wasn’t a ‘Space’ button or ‘Left/Right’ arrow keys to facilitate those functions. By having those functions, quality of labelling would be increased.
          </p>
          <p>
  The video starts instantly when loaded, meaning manual pausing and replaying of the video to properly label actions is required. The video should be paused by default so as to allow for easier labelling.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <p class="segmenthead">
  Good Features:
          </p>
          <p>
  Video automatically skips part where it detects there are no people around.</p><p>
  Unfortunately ‘Camera 1’ has an issue where it thinks that a potted plant was a person, so footage at Camera 1 did not get skipped.
          </p>
          <p>
  Font and color choice.</p><p>
  Having green as the color and Comic Sans as the font makes it easy to identify the tags in the video.
